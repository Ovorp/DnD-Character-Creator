# DnD-Character-Creator

This is a project for the no Database section of DevMountain

The front end is built with create-react-app, the server is NodeJS and express.  You can create a new character, or use/edit a default.  After that you can shop for items or delete them from your inventory (Once an item is moved from the store to an inventory/deleted the action, at this point, can not be undone).  The last part of the app is a summary page.

I am currently working on updating this readme
